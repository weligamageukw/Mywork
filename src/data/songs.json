   "description":"<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES<\/i> BESTSELLER<\/b> •<b> In the propulsive debut novel from the host of the #1 true crime podcast <i>Crime Junkie<\/i>, a journalist uncovers her hometown’s dark secrets when she becomes obsessed with the unsolved murder of her childhood neighbor—and the disappearance of another girl twenty years later.<br /><br />ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: <i>PopSugar<\/i><\/b><br />&#xa0;<br /><i>You can’t ever know for sure what happens behind closed doors.<\/i><br /><br />Everyone from Wakarusa, Indiana, remembers the infamous case of January Jacobs, who was discovered in a ditch hours after her family awoke to find her gone. Margot Davies was six at the time, the same age as January—and they were next-door neighbors. In the twenty years since, Margot has grown up, moved away, and become a big-city journalist. But she’s always been haunted by the feeling that it could’ve been her. And the worst part is, January’s killer has never been brought to justice.<br /><br />When Margot returns home to help care for her uncle after he is diagnosed with early-onset dementia, she feels like she’s walked into a time capsule. Wakarusa is exactly how she remembers—genial, stifled, secretive. Then news breaks about five-year-old Natalie Clark from the next town over, who’s gone missing under circumstances eerily similar to January’s. With all the old feelings rushing back, Margot vows to find Natalie and to solve January’s murder once and for all.<br /><br />But the police, Natalie’s family, the townspeople—they all seem to be hiding something. And the deeper Margot digs into Natalie’s disappearance, the more resistance she encounters, and the colder January’s case feels. Could January’s killer still be out there? Is it the same person who took Natalie? And what will it cost to finally discover what truly happened that night twenty years ago?<br /><br />Twisty, chilling, and intense,<i> All Good People Here<\/i> is a searing tale that asks: What are your neighbors capable of when they think no one is watching?"},

Even if the most obvious suspect was your father?<br /><br />This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings.<br /><br />The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after 50 years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable?<br /><br />The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon.<br /><br />One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted.<br /><br />Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.<br /><br /><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt and Company<\/b>"},

   "description":"Performed by Russ with his music featured throughout. <br /><br />Instant National Bestseller!&#xa0;Wall Street Journal&#xa0;bestseller;&#xa0;USA Today&#xa0;bestseller;&#xa0;Publishers Weekly&#xa0;bestseller; international bestseller.<br /><br />An inspirational book by self-made musical superstar, Russ, reminding you that it starts with YOU, to believe in yourself, and to get out of your own way.&#xa0;<br /><br />Twenty-seven-year-old rapper, songwriter, and producer Russ walks his own path, at his own pace. By doing so, he proved that he didn’t need a major label to surpass over a billion streams on Spotify/Apple Music, get on&#xa0;Forbes’&#xa0;2019 “30 Under 30,” make the&#xa0;Forbes‘ “30 Under 30 Cash Kings” at number 20 for most earned, sell out arenas across the U.S. and around the globe, and become one of the most popular and engaged rappers right now. His method was simple: love and believe in yourself absolutely and work hard no matter what. In this memoir, Russ inspires readers to walk to their individual rhythms and beat their biggest obstacles: themselves.<br /><br />With chapters named after his most powerful and popular songs,&#xa0;IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD&#xa0;will reflect on the lessons he’s learned from his career, family, and relationships. He’ll push readers to bet on themselves, take those leaps of faith, and recognize struggles as opportunities.&#xa0;IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD&#xa0;will give readers an inside-look at the man and the motivation behind the music. A lover of books like&#xa0;The Alchemist&#xa0;and&#xa0;The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, Russ delivers a short, potent, inspirational, raw, and honest book that gives readers a way to find self-belief and unlock their potential. Fans already rely on Russ as an inspiration of confidence; now, he is taking it to the next level with this book, which will contain lyrics from his music and visuals that reflect his inimitable style."},

Unfortunately, she wants to move the franchise to Miami, and a losing season is her only ticket to Florida. So she signs the wildest gang of screwballs that ever spit tobacco. They're handsome, but they're hopeless! Her catcher (Tom Berenger) is a washed-up womanizer who struck out in life. Her ace pitcher (Charlie Sheen) is a punked-out crazy who struck out with the law. And her third baseman (Corbin Bernsen) is more concerned fielding endorsements than grounders. Throw in a bus load of other misfits and you've got yourself a hilarious line-up that's destined for disaster! Also starring, Wesley Snipes and Rene Russo.", "hasITunesExtras":true},
